            <h4>Computer Engineer</h4>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Aninda. I have graduated from City College of New York with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. Computers have always fascinated me.
                Ever since my father got me my first computer with a operating system of windows 2000, I have known that I will spend my life tinkering with it. I somehow managed to "break"
                the computer within two months as it failed to start-up one day. In order to teach me responsibility, My father tasked me to fix the computer by myself. Thus I recieved my first task as an Engineer at the age of Eleven.
                Long story short I was able determine that the floppy drive was malfunctioning due to a coin being inserted in it. I strongly suspected my 7 yo brother to be the culprit but was never able to prove it. However, I still remerber the satisfaction of detecting the most complex problem I have faced to date when I physically
                unplugged the cable to Floppy disk driver and the computer finally started up. Ever since then I always seek that satisfaction of solving problems be it hardware or software.<br>
                Aside from tinkering with computers, I love web development. I stumbled onto web development during a database class and since then I have been part of plenty of full-stack projects. Most notably Career Pitch and Safemaps, throughout which
                I got to learn React, NodeJs + Express, HTML, Css, Javascript, MongoDB, Postgres etc. I enjoyed "building things on the web" thus I seeked out internship at "Workschool" as a full-stack Web-developer. It was a fullfilling Experience
                as I learnt nextJs, Typescript, AWS, Docker and used my skills to help build an educational platform.  <br>
                I am passionate about using my skills into solving real world application and I am an avid space-exploration enthusiast. In my free time I like to play strategy games(shout out to Paradox games) and Kerbal Space Program is the best game to ever come out.
